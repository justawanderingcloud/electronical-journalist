# Electronic Journalist
The project Electronic Journalist attempts to automate a routine journalistic work such as writing articles inviting readers to various events. It uses predefined templates that are pseudorandomly combined for a news article generation.

This proof of concept includes templates for generating articles inviting readers to watch a movie in a movie theatre.
